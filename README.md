# ü§ñ Real-Time Object Tracker with YOLOv8

An advanced computer vision system that uses the state-of-the-art YOLOv8 model to detect and track objects in a live webcam feed. The application assigns a persistent ID to each object, allowing for stable tracking across frames.

## ‚ú® Key Features

-   **State-of-the-Art Detection:** Powered by `ultralytics` YOLOv8, a highly accurate and efficient object detection model.
-   **Real-Time Tracking:** Assigns a unique and persistent ID to each detected object, allowing it to be tracked as it moves across the screen.
-   **Smart Logging:** The console only prints a message the **first time** a new object ID is detected, preventing a flood of repetitive logs.
-   **Automated Model Management:** The required YOLOv8 model is automatically downloaded on the first run.
-   **Simple & Efficient:** The code is clean, concise, and optimized for real-time performance on a standard webcam.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

-   **Python**
-   **Ultralytics YOLOv8:** The core library for object detection and tracking.
-   **OpenCV-Python:** Used for capturing and displaying the video feed.
